This is a clone of the Moodle weeks course format except the weeks are listed in reverse order.

All of the hard work was done by Sam Hemelryk, I have just reversed a few values.

All future weeks are hidden from the student view so that the current week is shown at the top of the list.

As a teacher you can see future weeks and should leave them unhidden so that they do become visible when that week arrives.
