moodle-format_weeksrev
=====================

Overview
--------
This is a clone of the Moodle weekly course format except the weeks are listed in reverse order.

Settings
--------
* Settings from standard weekly format
* __Hide future weeks__ (yes/no - default: yes): allow to hide all future weeks from the student view so that the current week is shown at the top of the list.
When enable it will completely override the course setting "Hidden sections" for future weeks.
As a teacher you can see future weeks and should leave them unhidden so that they do become visible when that week arrives.

Installation
------------
Install the plugin, like any other plugin.
See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins.
